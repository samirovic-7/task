I am very sorry that I did not catch up with the Senior task because of some situations. The task came suddenly and I was not arranged for it, and this is entirely my fault. When I started doing the task, I encountered a problem with your data base. It did not recognize my server. It took a lot of time and I started creating new data bases, but something happened. It happened but I will finish it and the Junior task also in anticipation of any request from you if I can upload it again if possible
